# Setting up a Big Data environment with Docker 

This is a school project for the course "Big Data". The goal is to set up a Big Data environment with Docker.  We chose to analyze League of Legends data using the Riot API.

We went throught a lot of hardships to find the right tool, finally we used the following tools:
- Spark 
- Apache Druid 
- Apache Superset

## Visualisation of the data

TODO : Add pictures of the visualisation
